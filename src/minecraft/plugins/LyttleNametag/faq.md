## FAQ

Frequently asked questions.

---

**How does LyttleNametag work?**

The plugin replaces the vanilla nametag with a display entity, which is riding the player. This allows us to have advanced colors, multiple lines and placeholder support.

**What are the limits of display entities?**

We do not have a fixed limit to text size or lines. Although, display entities do have limits that are not clearly documented. So its just experimenting. Although, we recommend you to dont pass these values for the best experience.

*Recommended max values:*

- Max lines: 8
- Max characters per line: 30
